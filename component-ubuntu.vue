								<h2>❤️Charity: the #Ubuntu Policy</h2>

								As part of our unbashed commitment to collaboration. 

								EV has an internal directive yei call "#ubuntu". 10%
								of yei 🍰 benefits tax is donated to 50% cyberspace; 50% the open source projects, 50% planet healing. 

								It is our goal to organizationally increase this as the company becomes more sustainable which we anticipate in mid-2020. 

								😁 Please .=email:ops+ubuntu@elastic.ventures;; for the #ubuntu administrator. Thanks!
