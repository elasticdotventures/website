								</h2>
								<h4>The Indoor Garden Appliance</h4>
								A residential "smart" (sensor integrated) cloud-monitored aeroponics appliance.
								<p>

									<p>
										GrowPotBot in both present and future versions will usher in a new
										industry of urban indoor farming & gardening.
										Helping humans minimize and correct the effects of climate change as it
										pertains to their food quality & selection, medicine availability, and
										pocket-book integrity.
										The GrowPotbot residential gardening appliance employs a closed-loop
										neural network monitoring system that cares for the genetics (plants)
										and will
										alarm owners to concerns such as plagues, pests, and pets who may be
										inhibiting growth. High power lights will provide year
										round growing cycles indoors, garages or patios; and super dense liquid
										fertilizers will accelerate plant grow up to 6x.
