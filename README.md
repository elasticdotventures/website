this is a test readme.

We have organizationally adopted a number of forward thinking "post scarcity economic" organizational models. 
Please review them below. 

#1. Safety First
										Safety First is rule #1 at Elastic.Ventures. 

										<h4>Art License || Branding Policy</h4>
										We may, with new releases include collectible stickers "art" in our packaging which include authorized 
										reproductions of our brand logo(s) and/or trademark(s). 
										It is not permitted to use the Art of any explicit robosexual acts. Seriously; we'd don't want to see our logo in 
										that type content. 

										<h4>No Weapons, Killer or Torture Robots**</h4>
										Cybernetic machines made of electrokinetic subassemblies could be extremely dangerous; and are basically esseintial in 
										building "terminators".  EV operates on a strict "No Lethal Weapons Development" policy.
										Items such as stun-guns and cattle prods should be used with care on people (especially siblings and pets); always 
										test at low voltages on yourself first. Safety First.  Further we will not sell kits that lack sufficient sensors (and 
										diagnostic loops) with sufficient safety redundancies to prevent accidental harm. 
										Low voltage non-lethal tasers and devices such as cattle prods are acceptable.  
										
										<h4>**Realism Virtual Simulation Exclusion</h4>
										Virtual Simulation "e-sports" or "decision by virtual combat diplomacy" necessary for Realistic Robotic Warfare simulations;
										using our cybernetic signal-bus models, AI ML models, or subassemblies is acceptable; PROVIDED the following is true:
										<ul>
											<li> You are a student, or team belonging to an academic institution and have received a passing grade or are concurrently enrolled in an Artificial Intelligence Ethics course.</li>
											<li> You do not publically reveal specific cybernetic sub-assembly steps. (Always keep your designs private; only provide them to a trusted simulation referees</li>
											<li> You must remove EV branding, or EV stickers on any simulated combat robotics. </li>
										</ul>

										<h4>Hackathon, e-Sport Policy</h4>
										EV may sponsor and encourage cooperative challenges "Hackathons"; 
										and other simulated arena battles "e-sports" between schools, companies, nations, or celebrites.
										These simulations may use physical real world models or other prominent figures such as AI representations of 
										world leaders to increase the realism effect.  Prototype simulation is a critical part of a great design and we expect
										to contribute significantly in the coming years to this emerging field. 		
										
										<h4>Why EV has a "No Weapons" Policy</h4>
										I bet you thought all American's loved to blow stuff up! 
										
										<p>
										Let's be clear, we're not snowflakes; we don't identify as tree hugging libtards; 
										we're not texas Trump wall lovers either. 
										What we're doing is very real. Ignore the ramifications; we want to make service robots and cyber subassemblies to make people, parents and pets lives better. 
										Further we also don't desire any of our products to labelled as weapons and subject to additional import/export restrictions. 
									</p><p>
											Unfortunately it's not possible to build quality eco-friendly recyclable and repairable service robots; 
										without also simulatenously making it just a bit easier to create nasty darkweb tech.  
										Circuit diagrams for killing or torture devices that would make midevil torture such as crucificition or disembowling
										(before invention of adrenaline) seem like a pleasant alternative. 
										What can be done to anybody these days; remotely with a simple a modern microprocessor driven torture device is extremely dark and unpleasant.

									</p><p>
											When preparing the EV ethics we have arrived at "ubuntu" as our morale guide; and we have included that into our product license. 
										Ubuntu simply states that humans can all originate from different villages; but we still have more in common, 
										including sharing the planet together.  Further that any society where free markets produce the elite 1% billionares should also be
										expected to provide humanitarian assistance and quality of life "help" to end things like hunger and suffering. 
									</p><p>
										
										We believe large scale affordable residential and light industry robotics (which come off the assembly line ready to work; 
										never sleep; and don't require any further training or education or sick days) are the best bet we've got to create low-cost
										solutions to solving human hunger, safety, suffering and discomfort. 
									</p><p>
																
										Modern society and governments exist because of a delicate balance that most people consent to "adhere to the law; and behave civily" towards eachother. 
										Robots do not excise such judgemental or morale restraints; they are very task and goal oriented; 
										accordingly one anti-social person giving out instructions can easily produce an untracable remote-controlled, 
										autonomous #hardforhumans to disarm killing machines; this can be done today out of spare parts e-waste. 
									</p><p>

										In America it is common to hear "the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun; is a good guy with a gun"; that might have
										been true when the US consititution was enshrined; when everybody had single shot rifles and handguns - but what about if everybody
										had killer robots - thats absolutely terrifying.  We don't want to live on that planet. 
									</p><p>
										
										Modern cybernetics is an industry that by simply existing finds it's moisture from the accquifer of science fiction. 
										Utter the words "Artificial Intelligence" and an average human will frequently conjure mental images of evil robotics 
										chasing people on space stations (HAL-9000) or going back in time to assasinate somebody (Terminator).  
									</p><p>

										It feels like most people have a poor grasp of history and have forgotten (or ignore) the visceral human suffering life cost of 
										WWI, WWII, Vietnam and tragic events like Sept 11th.  Nationalism and Authoritarianism is on the rise globally; 
										and cyberwar promises the ability to use a military against itself completely reshaping warfare, policing, 
										and international trade disputes to name just a few.  
									</p><p>
										
										The future is about to get weird, but it can be better.  AI ethics is about avoiding genocidal robots.  Rest assured that if 
										such a monstorous invention is ever created here at EV; all internal projects would be stoppped and hacking those robots 
										would become our top priority for this organization. That is our line.  Remember rule #1; Safety first.   
										That's my safety, that's our safety, that's looking out for your neighbor. 
									</p><p>

										It is our hope for the future that the inevitable battle simulations between companies, teams, countries 
										could be hosted and rendered in future World of Warcraft esque or geographically accurate e-battle-arenas between 
										multiple teams (i.e. countries; or schools) collaborating for a common prize -- all to serve as an example that thanks to 
										Chaos theory; no outcome is ever certain or optimal and with some game theories the only way to win is not play at all.
									</p><p>
					
										... and finally MOST importantly we're hoping our own EV technology isn't someday used to kill us; our loved ones, 
										or the rest of the humans; or even uthanize pets.  
										If your project lies in a grey area, and you want to use our tech, please write us and let's chat; we hate surprises. 
										Thanks in advance! 
									</p>

										<h4>Revocation of Trademark License</h4>
										Further, since we do not allow our trademarked designs to be used in any lethal weaponized or torture components 
										we additionally reserve the permission; that the usage of our components, designs, data-models,
										software or cybernetic sub-assemblies in a weaponized or torture robot; 
										with the purpose to harm non-simulated humans or animals authorizes EV to 
										execute whatever immediate take-down counter-measure protocols we feel justified (physical or DMCA electronic notice) and said party
										further agrees to indemnify Elastic.Ventures and pay a reasonable processing & waste disposal fee and will likely receive an 
										indefinite cease and desist on any and all future projects related to EV technology. 
										</p>
