								<h4>Residential & Light Industry Robotics Parts & Accessories</h4>
								<p>
									Cybernetics is the industry of building cloud connected or distributed AI
									powered integrated electronic and mechanical called mechatronic or
									electrokinetic components.
									Harmonized Robotics intends to provide "robot recipies" (kits) & shopping
									lists of parts, connectors, along with pre-assembled machine fabricated
									electrokinetic sub-assemblies,
									with integrated cybernetic signal buses (~1.8-36volt). Our products whenever
									possible will be provided with
									3d Printable sub-assemblies and cosmetic mounting options; together with
									open sourced design files with
									complete fullstack implementation documentation, data models and API's is
									the goal.
									We believe this approach will rapidly speed up robotic development for
									companies, schools and research all over the world.
								</p>
								<p>
									Manufacturing at the moment non-existant cross-industry connector pieces and
									sub-assembly kits for intelligent low voltage robotics.
									Beyond GrowPotBot we intend to produce some-assembly-required kits for
									obvious products like MowLawnBot, SnowBlowBot, DogTrainBot
									what we call "residential service robotics". The kits will snap together and
									affordably demonstrate the advantages of the harmonized robotics
									manufacturing strategy.
									We will also be a leader in producing 100% eco-friendly recyclable robotics
									and packaging pieces that can be easily repaired or locally recovered.
									Our policy with robotic kits is that IF a customer doesn't like our products
									within 90 days we will take responsibility for
									selling the product (as used; final sale) on eBay to another person in the
									same area with a full warranty.
