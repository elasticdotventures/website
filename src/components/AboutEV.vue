How vuetify spacing works

Vuetify helper classes apply margin or padding to an element ranging from 0 to 5. 
üëÜ note: Each size increment was designed to align with common Material Design spacings. 
These classes can be applied using the following format {property}{direction}-{size}.

üç∞ can helper classes be applied to all vuetify v-* classes? 

Vuetify spacing helper uses 
the leading character designates "property" either: m,p 
applies the type of spacing:

    m - (margin) applies margin    (outside border)
        --- border ---  
    p - (padding) applies padding  (inside border)
        --- content ---

// ü§ì margin vs. padding: 
DESIGN THEORY: 
TL;DR: By default I use margin everywhere, except when I have a border or background 
and want to increase the space inside that visible box.

margins are outside the element's block; 
padding is inside the element; moves contents away from edges. 

The direction designates the side the property applies to:

    t - applies the spacing for *-top
    b - applies the spacing for *-bottom
    l - applies the spacing for *-left
    r - applies the spacing for *-right
    x - applies the spacing for both *-left and *-right
    y - applies the spacing for both *-top and *-bottom
    a - applies the spacing for the property in all directions

The size controls the increment of the property:

    auto - sets the spacing to auto
    0 - removes the spacing by setting it to 0
    1 - sets the spacing to $spacer * .25
    2 - sets the spacing to $spacer * .5
    3 - sets the spacing to $spacer
    4 - sets the spacing to $spacer * 1.5
    5 - sets the spacing to $spacer * 3
