								<h2>About us</h2>
								<p>
									Elastic Ventures, Inc. "EV" is a California S Corp was established in 2014 as a professional consulting and services company.
									Since 2019 we have expanded globally to offer engineering and manufacturing interests in USA, China, and Malaysia.
									Focusing on lean-startup or NGO grant funded projects. 
								</p>
							<p>

									EV's goal to travel and locate commercial opportunities in the frontiers around the planet 
									of modern science hunting for the scientific recipe for what is known as a "Dark Swan" innovation to create "Unicorn" companie(s) on a universal framework.
									Study a variety of topics to identify and test viability. 
								</p>
								<p>The business plan (broadly): :study::pray::travel::planet:üòÅ.  Try to only build stuff that doesn't screw up the planet.
									Focus on ideas that are universal 'no brainers' useful enviromentally b-corporation aspirations 
									"leave no trace" or better than yei (we all of us, even the machines) found it. 
								</p>
								<p>
									The EV founder @b has prior experience in emerging technologies artificial intelligence, documentation and tests, 
									IOT sensor design fabrication, early open source & cloud, first to market e-commerce saas & client/server mobile apps. 
									Numerous contributions in early Linux, and DNS Policy discussion; adoption of open source in 
									education, libraries, and government technical grant writing and execution.

									Since 2015; The EV team has been searching for the "Dark Swan in Unicorn Clothes" while peddling various consulting technical
									services and travelling around the world (40 countries; continuous nomad since 2016) working remotely, worldwide Internet deployment,
									curating the latest business and technology trends and science papers looking for opportunities in autonomous vehicles, drones, and operated 6 CNC and 3d printing systems. 
									At the same time developing an internal process for tracking these types of designs; a toolchain for new employees to curate the content.  

									This includes the exciting emerging fields of aeroponic agriculture, cybernetics, specifically sensor & case design, fabrication, 
									closed loop sensors 
									with quality and reliability.  Trying to identify best practices in sensor design and reliability; avoid counterfeiting worldwide
									to bring new versions of their raw materials together to create new markets, build the development and production laboratory; deliver direct to the market
									(using logistics partners).   A "sears catalog" of sensors and engineering mentorship expertise in "AI Sensor Operation Training" manuals; things of that nature
									while developing the knowledge how to create these first hand in the field. 
								</p>
								<p>
									EV is tooled differently than other companies; we have a global slack-chat bot "@eva" culture and efficient hive protocols for conversation 
									and reaching consensus "see: Roberts Rules of Order". We offer all #human a standard universal income and exemplary benefits package including work-travel  
									abroad experience for international collaboration.  We provide merit bonuses based on culture and team success; and use a unified "harmonized" overlapping design syntax across departments.
									Usually nautical "pirate crew" of chemical, mechanical, electrical, integrated material
									and smart software engineers (who can be notiriously difficult to intrinsically motivate if organizational goals are not aligned). 
								</p>
								<p>
									EV places an emphasis on Safety, 				
									Durability in the field; and post-use recyclability with open design and right to repair maintaining a Github repo http://github.com/elasticdotventures
									with artifacts.
