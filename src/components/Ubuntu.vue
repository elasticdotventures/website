								<h2>‚ù§Ô∏è Humanity: #Ubuntu &amp; Universal Income</h2>

								As part of EV's commitment to providing a better planet for people. 
								All #humans receive Universal Income "teachers salary" based on the locale they live &amp; work. 

								EV has an internal directive yei call "#ubuntu". 
								10% of yei üç∞ benefits tax is donated to 50% cyberspace; 50% the open source projects, 50% planet healing. 

								It is our goal to organizationally increase this as the company becomes more sustainable which we anticipate in mid-2020.
